# EHealth iOS application
This repository contains the code for the EHealth iOS application written for the SES1A subject at the University of Sydney Technology.

## Installation
Unfortunately this app is not available on the App Store yet as it is still under review by Apple.

To install this project you must first have XCode installed on Apple computer. Unfortunately due to Apple's restrictions you can't use Windows for this. You must then clone this repository. Then, open a terminal and navigate to the cloned repository. Then run ```pod install```, if you don't have CocoaPods installed then you can read how to do so [here](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#toc_3). After this open the ```.xcworkspace``` file in XCode and click the run button. This will install it on a simulator and allow it to be run.
